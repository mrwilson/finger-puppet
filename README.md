## finger-puppet

  finger-puppet allows execution of puppet manifests like scripts, and accepts both stdin or commandline arguments. These features allows you to leverage puppet's configuration management system to create idempotent scripts.

  Examples in `examples/`

## TODO

* Serf integration, pass through `SERF_EVENT` etc. into facter (already spiked, but needs tidying up)
* Testing
